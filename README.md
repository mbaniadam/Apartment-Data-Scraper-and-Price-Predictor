# Apartment-Data-Scraper-and-Price-Predictor
This Python script scrapes apartment data from the Immowelt.de website and helps users find an apartment based on desired area and number of rooms. If no matching apartments are found, the script predicts the price of a desired apartment in a desired city using machine learning technology based on data from the website.
